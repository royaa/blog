Attention Tiny Framework translators! Most likely you will be using Poedit software to prepare the translation files. When you will be updating your translation, please use the menu option:

Top menu > Catalog > Update from POT file...

and select included tiny-framework.pot file. This is necessary, because just by scanning sources you will not get all strings that are required for the full theme translation. Read more about translating Tiny Framework theme:
